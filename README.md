# Milan for tourists

*Currently under construction. Last update May, 2015*

## A brief intro

If you're travelling to Italy you have tons of places to visit before feeling the need to add Milan to your list. In the unfortunate (according to some) case you're going to visit this big city, here you can find some useful information and tips curated by locals that may make your staying more pleasurable.

Since this guide can't and won't cover everything, feel free to ask on Reddit by [paging me](https://www.reddit.com/user/tekanet/) or posting a question to [/r/Italy](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy)

## Getting around

### Underground, buses, trams, trains

The two main companies managing public transportation are ATM and Trenord. There are lot of ticket combinations and special fares but the most important thing you need to know is that **with an ATM 1.50 EUR ticket you can travel within the whole urban area** (1 Metro trip, unlimited movements on buses, trams and trains (S lines operated by Trenord) within 90 minutes limit). Be aware that some key places like EXPO, Fiera, Forum di Assago are outside urban area and require a different ticket. Tickets can be purchased at automatic machines in every station using cash or credit card.

### From and to airports

Milan has 2 airports: Linate is very close to the city while Malpensa is a bit far. Bergamo Orio Al Serio is often seen as a Milan airport, since it's quite close too. Moving to and from Linate and Malpensa is easier while flights and movements to and from Bergamo are usually cheaper. 

#### Malpensa (MPX)

Malpensa has 2 terminals, connected by a free shuttle 24/7 (every 7 minutes, 30 during night hours).

Best way to reach Milan is by train. Trains to Cadorna (underground lines 1 and 2) and Centrale (underground lines 2 and 3) departs from Terminal 1 every 30 minutes. Train is called "Malpensa Express" and tickets start from 12€.

# Food and drinks

Italians have an opinion about everything, even on topics they don't know at all. When it comes to food, we are trained as chefs and critics from within the cradle. The following list expresses the taste of the authors. Generally speaking, you can find good food without spending too much: prices are however usually higher than the rest of Italy. Check the menu before ordering and feel free to leave. Tripadvisor and Yelp are good sources for reviews, check the place you're going to. If you don't want to end up paying high bills keep in mind this tips:

- don't order anything if you don't know the price (not listed, suggested by the waiter)
- fancy locations cost a lot more
- when there's live music or sport events there's usually a surcharge

## Food to go

> [/u/Styropian](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/11kee5/ill_be_in_milan_for_one_day_what_should_i_do/c6n9yqs): "Food on the go, da [Luini](http://www.luini.it/), off piazza duomo. You wont regret it. There will be a huge line but dont fret, they are rapid". Visitor [/u/atomaniac](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/11kee5/ill_be_in_milan_for_one_day_what_should_i_do/c6o9og4) enjoyed his meal: "Luini was awesome. Most delicious fried crap ever!" 

## Pizza

> [brett35](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/svsus/any_tips_for_three_swedes_in_milano/c4hfkna): "Avoid the center when you eat. Overpriced tourist traps. If you have never tried real italian pizza go to '[Solo Pizza](https://www.facebook.com/pages/SoloPizza-Premuda/259953420704733)', viale Premuda 13. Best pizza in the city, awful looking place but it's worth it, I promise. Go!"

> [/u/a\\_red_crayola](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/11kee5/ill_be_in_milan_for_one_day_what_should_i_do/c6nazmd): "Also, in case you want some pizza: pizzeria [Fresco](http://www.frescocimmino.it/) - I haven't seen it listed in any other thread; it's a nice, traditional pizza. A big plus, it's close to piazza Duomo"

## Happy hour / aperitivo

> [[deleted user]](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/11kee5/ill_be_in_milan_for_one_day_what_should_i_do/c6nbbb3): "Great place to eat: [Pane & Vin](http://www.panevinomilano.com/)o at Via Torino, during the happy hour - you'll get a cocktail and a nice buffet for 8 or 9€. There's another "apperitivo" place called "Cheese" and which is next to the Columns of San Lorenzo"

## Vegetarian an vegan

Vegetarian and vegan meals are pretty easy to find everywhere. There are however places where the kitchen is specifically vegetarian or vegan.

- [Flower Burger](http://www.flowerburger.it/): in the last 2 or 3 years, places selling hamburgers sprouted all around the city. Most of the times they all have a vegan burger in their list, but if you're looking for a place completely Veg, head to this place in Porta Venezia. Their burgers look delicious on their [instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/flower_burger/)!

# Points of interest

## History, art, museums

- [Cenacolo Vinciano](http://www.vivaticket.it/index.php?nvpg[evento]&id_show=63954&idt=744) (Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper): one of the most interesting pieces of art in Milan, can be seen by purchasing tickets in advance from [this website](http://www.vivaticket.it/index.php?nvpg[tour]&id=744&wms_op=cenacoloVinciano). Without a ticket purchased in advance (some months earlier) it is almost impossible to enter. 

> [/u/bonzinip](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/svsus/any_tips_for_three_swedes_in_milano/c4heb30) adds, referring to Cenacolo: "Also, S.ta Maria delle Grazie is worth a visit even if you do not go to see Last Supper; the cloister is lovely. Sant'Ambrogio is close, too."

> [brett35](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/svsus/any_tips_for_three_swedes_in_milano/c4hfkna): "Check the '[Castello Sforzesco](http://www.milanocastello.it/)', it's a huge castle right in the center of the city, walking distance from Duomo. It has several museums inside."

> [/u/dedioste](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/11kee5/ill_be_in_milan_for_one_day_what_should_i_do/c6neekp): "If you are into modern/contemporary art, check out what's on at [PAC](http://www.pacmilano.it/en/) (padiglione arte contemporanea) or stop by [Casa Museo Boschi Di Stefano](http://www.fondazioneboschidistefano.it/ws/en/). Both free or very cheap for young people/students."

> [/u/bonzinip](): "Natural History Museum is decent and close to a nice park, while the Pinacoteca di Brera gallery is close to good eating places; S.ta Maria presso S. Satiro is a small church with an interesting trompe l'oeuil; Rotonda della Besana is a quiet park. Check out exhibitions at Palazzo Reale, same square as Duomo, usually interesting."

### Walls and ancient remnants

Small parts of the walls once surrounding Milan are visible around the city. While walls are mostly lost, different city access gates are still in their place from Roman, medieval and Spanish eras. 

* Walls of Milan [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walls_of_Milan#Roman_walls)]
* San Lorenzo's columns [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonne_di_San_Lorenzo)]
  
> [/u/italianjob17](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/svsus/any_tips_for_three_swedes_in_milano/c4hh97w): "S.Lorenzo's columns will be the best roman you can hope to get there. Sadly not much is left visible of Roman Mediolanum."

# Shopping

## Fashion

Quadrilatero della Moda [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilatero_della_moda)] is where the big names and expensive boutiques are. Even if you're not buying anything, this area is well mantained and nice for strolling. More popular shopping can be done in Corso Vittorio Emanuele [[Google Maps](https://www.google.it/maps/place/Corso+Vittorio+Emanuele+II,+20122+Milano/)] and Galleria Vittorio Emanuele close to Piazza Duomo. Other streets packed with stores for (almost) every pocket are Via Torino [[Google Maps](https://www.google.it/maps/place/Via+Torino,+20123+Milano)] and Corso Buenos Aires [[Google Maps](https://www.google.it/maps/place/Corso+Buenos+Aires,+Milano)].

> [/u/brett35](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/svsus/any_tips_for_three_swedes_in_milano/c4hfkna): "Expensive italian shopping: Via della Spiga e Via Montenapoleone. All the area around there is uber expensive with the most important fashion brands having their main stores here. (The Navigli area also has a lot of vintage shops and more down to earth stores)"

- La Rinascente [[Website](http://www.rinascente.it/rinascente/en/)] is a high end department store close to Piazza Duomo, selling dresses, fine food and design households. Expensive bar and restaurant have a breathtaking view of Duomo.

# Staying

Finding a place to stay should not be very difficult; finding a cheap one it's a whole different story. Hotels are in every neighborhood. Ostello Bello is a cheap option, being a hostel. Some people are probably offering a room via Airbnb: Navigli, Brera and all the area within the inner city ring (Cerchia dei Navigli) are good to go. 

If you're looking for a cheaper option you may search a Bed&Breakfast outside the city: nearby towns are sometimes nicer than periphery and some are very well connected by suburban train lines.

- Ostello Bello is the only well-known hostel in Milan; it has nice reviews. [[Website](http://www.ostellobello.com/en)] [[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Ostello.Bello)] [[Tripadvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187849-d2339007-Reviews-Ostello_Bello-Milan_Lombardy.html)]

> [/u/killerapp](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/11kee5/ill_be_in_milan_for_one_day_what_should_i_do/c6n9tc9): "I'd suggest [Ostello Bello](http://www.ostellobello.com/en) conveniently located (close to city center and Colonne di San Lorenzo - nightlife)"

- Bed and Breakfast Gorini [[Website in Italian](http://www.risogorini.it/bedandbreakfast.html)] is a nice B&B in Gaggiano, a small town about 10 Km far from Milan. This B&B is at 1 minute walking distance to the local train station. Trains from Gaggiano reach Romolo (underground 2, green), Porta Romana (undeground 3, yellow), Forlanini (close to Linate Airport), Lambrate (underground 2, green). Be aware that options for dinner and nightlife are close to zero.
