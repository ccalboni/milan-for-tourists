# Milan for tourists

*Currently under construction. Last update May, 2015*

## A brief intro

If you're travelling to Italy you have tons of places to visit before feeling the need to add Milan to your list. In the unfortunate (according to some) case you're going to visit this big city, here you can find some useful information and tips curated by locals that may make your staying more pleasurable.

Since this guide can't and won't cover everything, feel free to ask on Reddit by [paging me](https://www.reddit.com/user/tekanet/) or posting a question to [/r/Italy](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy)

## Getting around

### Underground, buses, trams, trains

The two main companies managing public transportation are ATM and Trenord. There are lot of ticket combinations and special fares but the most important thing you need to know is that **with an ATM 1.50 EUR ticket you can travel within the whole urban area** (1 Metro trip, unlimited movements on buses, trams and trains (S lines operated by Trenord) within 90 minutes limit). Be aware that some key places like EXPO, Fiera, Forum di Assago are outside urban area and require a different ticket.

- ATM [[Website](http://www.atm.it/en/Pages/default.aspx)], [[Mobile apps](http://www.atm.it/it/ViaggiaConNoi/Pagine/ATMMobile.aspx)]: underground (Metropolitana Milanese, red M sign), surface buses and trams
- Trenord [[Website](http://www.trenord.it/)]: trains and suburban S lines (violet S sign)

### From and to airports

Milan has 2 airports: Linate is very close to the city while Malpensa is a bit far. Bergamo Orio Al Serio is often seen as a Milan airport, since it's quite close too. Moving to and from Linate and Malpensa is easier while flights and movements to and from Bergamo are usually cheaper. 

#### Malpensa (MPX)

#### Linate (LIN)

Bus 73 operates from Linate to San Babila (city center, close to Piazza Duomo, underground line M1) every 5 to 10 minutes, takes around 45 minutes. Urban ATM ticket (1.50€).

Bus line LIN operates from Linate to Porta Vittoria (railway lines S1, S2, S5, S6, S13, S14, bus lines 90 and 91), every 10 minutes, takes around 30 minutes. Urban ATM ticket (1.50€). 

*At the beginning of May, 2015, railway station Forlanini (railway lines S1, S6, S9) opened: this station is very close to the airport but since it's quite new, no information is yet available about which bus line stops nearby*  

#### Bergamo Orio al Serio (BGY) 

### Train stations
- Milano Centrale: underground lines 1 (red) and 2 (green). Trains to Malpensa Airport. Buses to Bergamo Orio Al Serio airport.
- Garibaldi: underground lines 2 (green) and 5 (violet). 

### Bike sharing

Starting from 4.50€ daily plus 1€ per hour, you can rent a bike with ATM's "BikeMi". There are [more than 300 stations](https://www.bikemi.com/en/stations-map.aspx) around the city.

# Food and drinks

Italians have an opinion about everything, even on topics they don't know at all. When it comes to food, we are trained as chefs and critics from within the cradle. The following list expresses the taste of the authors. Generally speaking, you can find good food without spending too much: prices are however usually higher than the rest of Italy. Check the menu before ordering and feel free to leave. Tripadvisor and Yelp are good sources for reviews, check the place you're going to. If you don't want to end up paying high bills keep in mind this tips:

- don't order anything if you don't know the price (not listed, suggested by the waiter)
- fancy locations cost more
- when there's live music, exibitions, sport events projected there's usually a surcharge

## Food to go

> [/u/Styropian](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/11kee5/ill_be_in_milan_for_one_day_what_should_i_do/c6n9yqs): "Food on the go, da [Luini](http://www.luini.it/), off piazza duomo. You wont regret it. There will be a huge line but dont fret, they are rapid". Visitor [/u/atomaniac](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/11kee5/ill_be_in_milan_for_one_day_what_should_i_do/c6o9og4) enjoyed his meal: "Luini was awesome. Most delicious fried crap ever!" 

## Pizza

> [brett35](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/svsus/any_tips_for_three_swedes_in_milano/c4hfkna): "Avoid the center when you eat. Overpriced tourist traps. If you have never tried real italian pizza go to '[Solo Pizza](https://www.facebook.com/pages/SoloPizza-Premuda/259953420704733)', viale Premuda 13. Best pizza in the city, awful looking place but it's worth it, I promise. Go!"

> [/u/a\\_red_crayola](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/11kee5/ill_be_in_milan_for_one_day_what_should_i_do/c6nazmd): "Also, in case you want some pizza: pizzeria [Fresco](http://www.frescocimmino.it/) - I haven't seen it listed in any other thread; it's a nice, traditional pizza. A big plus, it's close to piazza Duomo"

## Happy hour / aperitivo

> [[deleted user]](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/11kee5/ill_be_in_milan_for_one_day_what_should_i_do/c6nbbb3): "Great place to eat: [Pane & Vin](http://www.panevinomilano.com/)o at Via Torino, during the happy hour - you'll get a cocktail and a nice buffet for 8 or 9€. There's another "apperitivo" place called "Cheese" and which is next to the Columns of San Lorenzo"

# Points of interest

## History, art, museums

- [Cenacolo Vinciano](http://www.vivaticket.it/index.php?nvpg[evento]&id_show=63954&idt=744) (Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper): one of the most interesting pieces of art in Milan, can be seen by purchasing tickets in advance from [this website](http://www.vivaticket.it/index.php?nvpg[tour]&id=744&wms_op=cenacoloVinciano). Without a ticket purchased in advance (some months earlier) it is almost impossible to enter. 

> [/u/bonzinip](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/svsus/any_tips_for_three_swedes_in_milano/c4heb30) adds, referring to Cenacolo: "Also, S.ta Maria delle Grazie is worth a visit even if you do not go to see Last Supper; the cloister is lovely. Sant'Ambrogio is close, too."

> [brett35](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/svsus/any_tips_for_three_swedes_in_milano/c4hfkna): "Check the '[Castello Sforzesco](http://www.milanocastello.it/)', it's a huge castle right in the center of the city, walking distance from Duomo. It has several museums inside."

> [/u/dedioste](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/11kee5/ill_be_in_milan_for_one_day_what_should_i_do/c6neekp): "If you are into modern/contemporary art, check out what's on at [PAC](http://www.pacmilano.it/en/) (padiglione arte contemporanea) or stop by [Casa Museo Boschi Di Stefano](http://www.fondazioneboschidistefano.it/ws/en/). Both free or very cheap for young people/students."

> [/u/bonzinip](): "Natural History Museum is decent and close to a nice park, while the Pinacoteca di Brera gallery is close to good eating places; S.ta Maria presso S. Satiro is a small church with an interesting trompe l'oeuil; Rotonda della Besana is a quiet park. Check out exhibitions at Palazzo Reale, same square as Duomo, usually interesting."

### Walls and ancient remnants

Small parts of the walls once surrounding Milan are visible around the city. While walls are mostly lost, different city access gates are still in their place from Roman, medieval and spanish eras. 

* Walls of Milan [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walls_of_Milan#Roman_walls)]
* San Lorenzo's columns [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonne_di_San_Lorenzo)]
  
> [/u/italianjob17](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/svsus/any_tips_for_three_swedes_in_milano/c4hh97w): "S.Lorenzo's columns will be the best roman you can hope to get there. Sadly not much is left visible of Roman Mediolanum."

# Shopping

## Fashion

> [/u/brett35](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/svsus/any_tips_for_three_swedes_in_milano/c4hfkna): "Expensive italian shopping: Via della Spiga e Via Montenapoleone. All the area around there is uber expensive with the most important fashion brands having their main stores here. (The Navigli area also has a lot of vintage shops and more down to earth stores)"

# Staying

> [/u/killerapp](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/11kee5/ill_be_in_milan_for_one_day_what_should_i_do/c6n9tc9): "I'd suggest [Ostello Bello](http://www.ostellobello.com/en) conveniently located (close to city center and Colonne di San Lorenzo - nightlife)"
