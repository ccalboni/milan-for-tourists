## Getting around

### Underground, buses, trams, trains

The two main companies managing public transportation are ATM and Trenord. There are lot of ticket combinations and special fares but the most important thing you need to know is that **with an ATM 1.50 EUR ticket you can travel within the whole urban area**, 1 Metro trip, unlimited movements on buses, trams and trains (S lines operated by Trenord) within 90 minutes limit. Be aware that some key places like EXPO, Fiera, Forum di Assago are outside urban area and require a different ticket.
