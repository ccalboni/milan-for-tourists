## A brief intro

If you're travelling to Italy you have tons of places to visit before feeling the need to add Milan to your list. In the unfortunate (according to some) case you're going to visit this big city, here you can find some useful information and tips curated by locals that may make your staying more pleasurable.

Since this guide can't and won't cover everything, feel free to ask on Reddit by [paging me](https://www.reddit.com/user/tekanet/) or posting a question to [/r/Italy](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy)

## Getting around

### Underground, buses, trams, trains

The two main companies managing public transportation are ATM and Trenord. There are lot of ticket combinations and special fares but the most important thing you need to know is that **with an ATM 1.50 EUR ticket you can travel within the whole urban area**, 1 Metro trip, unlimited movements on buses, trams and trains (S lines operated by Trenord) within 90 minutes limit. Be aware that some key places like EXPO, Fiera, Forum di Assago are outside urban area and require a different ticket.

# Food and drinks

## Food to go

* [/u/Styropian](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/11kee5/ill_be_in_milan_for_one_day_what_should_i_do/c6n9yqs): "Food on the go, da [Luini](http://www.luini.it/), off piazza duomo. You wont regret it. There will be a huge line but dont fret, they are rapid". [/u/atomaniac](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/11kee5/ill_be_in_milan_for_one_day_what_should_i_do/c6o9og4) enjoyed his meal: "Luini was awesome. Most delicious fried crap ever!" 

## Pizza

* [brett35](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/svsus/any_tips_for_three_swedes_in_milano/c4hfkna): "Avoid the center when you eat. Overpriced tourist traps. If you have never tried real italian pizza go to '[Solo Pizza](https://www.facebook.com/pages/SoloPizza-Premuda/259953420704733)', viale Premuda 13. Best pizza in the city, awful looking place but it's worth it, I promise. Go!"

* [/u/a\\_red_crayola](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/11kee5/ill_be_in_milan_for_one_day_what_should_i_do/c6nazmd): "Also, in case you want some pizza: pizzeria [Fresco](http://www.frescocimmino.it/) - I haven't seen it listed in any other thread; it's a nice, traditional pizza. A big plus, it's close to piazza Duomo"

## Happy hour / aperitivo

* [[deleted user]](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/11kee5/ill_be_in_milan_for_one_day_what_should_i_do/c6nbbb3): "Great place to eat: [Pane & Vin](http://www.panevinomilano.com/)o at Via Torino, during the happy hour - you'll get a cocktail and a nice buffet for 8 or 9€. There's another "apperitivo" place called "Cheese" and which is next to the Columns of San Lorenzo"

# Points of interest

## History

* [Cenacolo Vinciano](http://www.vivaticket.it/index.php?nvpg[evento]&id_show=63954&idt=744) (Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper): one of the most interesting pieces of art in Milan, can be seen by purchasing tickets in advance from [this website](http://www.vivaticket.it/index.php?nvpg[tour]&id=744&wms_op=cenacoloVinciano). Without a ticket purchased in advance (some months earlier) it is almost impossible to enter.

* [brett35](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/svsus/any_tips_for_three_swedes_in_milano/c4hfkna): "Check the '[Castello Sforzesco](http://www.milanocastello.it/)', it's a huge castle right in the center of the city, walking distance from Duomo. It has several museums inside."

## Art

* [/u/dedioste](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/11kee5/ill_be_in_milan_for_one_day_what_should_i_do/c6neekp): "If you are into modern/contemporary art, check out what's on at [PAC](http://www.pacmilano.it/en/) (padiglione arte contemporanea) or stop by [Casa Museo Boschi Di Stefano](http://www.fondazioneboschidistefano.it/ws/en/). Both free or very cheap for young people/students."
